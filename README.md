# Statistical Programming for the Social Sciences Using R

***Statistical Programming for the Social Sciences Using R*** (SPSSUR) is a second-year undergraduate-level course taught on the Sciences Po campus in Reims, France for the <a href ="https://syllabus.sciencespo.fr/cours/202320/244816.html">Spring 2024</a> semester.  

The course is intended to provide students with a broad introduction to the applications of statistical programming within the social sciences and beyond.  It is primarily designed for students with a basic knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistics and minimal or no experience in programming. Topics include data structures and types, data cleaning, descriptive analysis, regression analysis, data visualization, textual analysis, and web-scraping.  We use R as our tool of choice for this class.
