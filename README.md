Welcome! This is the git repo for Statistical Programming for the Social Sciences Using R (SPSSUR), a second year introductory R course taught at the Sciences Po Reims campus for the Spring 2024 semester. This repo contains the companion course textbook, written using Quarto, and (eventually) the course slides.

You can find the live course textbook <a href="https://wstubenbord.github.io/ScPoSPSSUR/">here</a>.
