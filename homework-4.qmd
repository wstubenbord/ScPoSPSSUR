# Homework 4 {.unnumbered}

**Due Date:** Wednesday, April 10 by 23:59:59

**Instructions:** For this homework, you will need to submit a zipped R Project folder containing an R Script or Quarto document with your code and data to Moodle.[^homework-4-1] The usual naming/header conventions and standards apply.

[^homework-4-1]: The assignment submission portal is under *Session 8.*

**Question 1**

Do U.S. adults with more children work more hours? Use the `gss_2022_extract.dta` data set posted on Moodle to investigate the relationship between hours worked per week (`hrs1`) and number of children (`childs`). Control for age and whether the respondent is divorced or not (`divorced`). Then, in a brief comment, interpret the coefficients, making sure to note which are statistically significant.

**Question 2**

Use the `gss_2022_extract.dta` data set to investigate the relationship between voting behavior in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and immigration policy preferences. Specifically, run a regression which estimates the relationship between voting for Trump in the 2020 election and support for deporting undocumented immigrants (`immfate`).[^homework-4-2]

[^homework-4-2]: The corresponding GSS question for `immfate` is: "What should be done about immigrants who are currently living in the U.S. illegally?" The response options were: 'BECOME CITIZENS', 'BECOME PERMANENT LEGAL RESIDENTS', and 'IDENTIFIED AND DEPORTED'.

In your regression, control for the effects of gender, age, whether the respondent identifies as Hispanic or not, whether they were born in the U.S. (`nativity`), and whether they obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree (or higher) or not. In a comment, interpret the relevant coefficient(s) and indicate which variables are statistically significant.

**Question 3**

Use the `gss_sm` data set from the `socviz` package to determine whether there is an association between political orientation (`polviews`) and happiness (`happy`). Briefly interpret the results and describe the association (if any).
